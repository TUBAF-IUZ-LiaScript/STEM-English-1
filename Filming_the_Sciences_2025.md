# Filming the Sciences 2025

Dear 11th graders of Geschwister Scholl Gymnasium Nossen,

Thank you for taking part in judging the films made by the students of TU Bergakademie Freiberg and Dnipro university of Technology.

Materials Science and Chemistry students from Freiberg worked together with Marketing and Journalism students from Dnipro to produce short films with the aim of communicating science to young people such as 11th graders like you.

As a class, please give ratings (e.g. 5 stars is the highest rating and 1 star is the lowest) for each film using the following criteria:

1. Could you understand the language used?
2. Were you entertained?
3. Did the film get you interested in science and technology?
4. Did you like the style of the film?
5. How would you rate the video overall?

For each film please add comments about:

1. Things you liked
2. Things you found memorable

Afterwards, your teacher will send your results to me in Freiberg and they will be used to decide which prizes are given in an award ceremony on Thursday afternoon here in Freiberg. (Note to teacher: You can send me a photo of the results written on paper or a Word or Excel document.)

Have fun!

Best regards,

Mark Jacob

Lecturer in English for Specific Purposes & Professional Communication at TU Bergakademie Freiberg
