# Road Map for Einführung in die Fachsprache

> WordValue will be implemented in three courses:

1. Einführung in die Fachsprache für Mathematik (5 first-year students)

- Introduction to WordValue (15 minutes) including pre-tasks questionnaire: Monday 13th November
- Students acquaint themselves with WordValue (including watching YouTube videos): by Monday 20th November
- WordValue used in class to search for technical vocabulary in articles: Monday 20th November
- Students' presentations and post-tasks questionnaire: Monday 27th November

2. Einführung in die Fachsprache für Chemie (20 first-year students)

- Introduction to WordValue (15 minutes) including pre-tasks questionnaire: Thursday 16th November
- Students acquaint themselves with WordValue (including watching YouTube videos): by Thursday 23rd November
- WordValue used in class to search for technical vocabulary in articles: Thursday 23rd November
- Students' presentations and post-tasks questionnaire: Thursday 30th November

3. Einführung in die Fachsprache für Informatik/Robotik (20 first-year students)

## Task 1

## 1

- use [Kilgarriff’s frequency lists](https://www.kilgarriff.co.uk/bnc-readme.html) to grey out all common words in a text or video to concentrate on more advanced vocabulary

> the lists contain over 6000 words and should work quite well; use the lemma.num list because WordValue has an inbuilt lemmatiser anyway
> students can then analyse the words and find out, for instance, that there are no grammatical words left
> we need to play round with how many words to use in order to achieve a meaningful rest in this way, since e.g. equilibrium already comes around rank 4000
>> ask the students to play round with the size of the list (e.g. the first 2500 lemmas)
>> self-reflection: how many words do they know already, and where in the frequency ranking does specifically technical vocabulary start? (<> some technical vocabulary is part of general language)

- problem-based learning

![](/images/sample_text_wordvalue.png)

- in the example above, the 200 most frequent words are greened out
- one could also produce a table with the most frequent words AND the academic word list (with different codes in the second column, so that they can be distinguished by their colour)
> it is surprising to see how dense the remaining black text is

- the students may also have some ideas themselves what they could look for
> it is a qualification to be able to identify questions and come up with possible questions that can be answered by applying a specific tool
