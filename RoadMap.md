# Road Map for Einführung in die Fachsprache

## Courses for implementation of WV

> WordValue will be implemented in three courses with approximately 45 students:

1. Einführung in die Fachsprache für Mathematik (5 first-year students)

- Introduction to WordValue (30 minutes) including pre-tasks questionnaire: Monday 13th November
- Students acquaint themselves with WordValue (including watching YouTube videos): by Monday 20th November
- WordValue used in class 1 to search for technical vocabulary in articles: Monday 20th November
- WordValue used in class 2 to investigate technical and general vocabulary: Monday 27th November
- Students' presentations and post-tasks questionnaire: Monday 3rd December

2. Einführung in die Fachsprache für Chemie (20 first-year students)

- Introduction to WordValue (15 minutes) including pre-tasks questionnaire: Thursday 16th November
- Students acquaint themselves with WordValue (including watching YouTube videos): by Thursday 23rd November
- WordValue used in class 1 to search for technical vocabulary in articles: Thursday 23rd November
- WordValue used in class 2 to investigate technical and general vocabulary: Thursday 30th November
- Students' presentations and post-tasks questionnaire: Thursday 6th December

3. Einführung in die Fachsprache für Informatik/Robotik (20 first-year students)

- Introduction to WordValue (15 minutes) including pre-tasks questionnaire: Thursday 16th November
- Students acquaint themselves with WordValue (including watching YouTube videos): by Thursday 23rd November
- WordValue used in class 1 to search for technical vocabulary in articles: Thursday 23rd November
- WordValue used in class 2 to investigate technical and general vocabulary: Thursday 30th November
- Students' presentations and post-tasks questionnaire: Thursday 6th December

## Introduction to WordValue

> Preparation session (30 minutes in class)
> Goal: all S have completed pre-task questionnaire, have a WV account and are familiar with WV

1. S complete pre-tasks questionnaire
2. T demonstrates WV with texts and tables
3. S set up WV account
4. S try WV with sample text and table
5. S ask T questions and T clears up issues

> Acquaintance (30 minutes independently)
> Goal: Students get to grips with WV in their own time

1. S watch introductory videos on how to use WordValue
2. S email T with any remaining questions about WV
3. T replies to emails and clears up issues

## Implementation of WV in class 1 (90 minutes)

> Text work
> Goal: to use WV in given and S own texts to extract vocabulary

1. S divided into two groups, S1 and S2
2. S1 receives [High entropy alloys: Structural disorder and magnetic properties](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/10/221020125940.htm)
3. S2 receives [Advances in water-splitting catalysts](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/10/221020122953.htm)
4. S receive table with 6000 most frequently occurring words https://www.kilgarriff.co.uk/bnc-readme.html
5. S use WordValue to extract 10 technical terms
6. S form dyads (S1 + S2) and compare results
7. Dyads search for another text and extract 10 technical terms
8. Group discussions and conclusions

## Implementation in class 2 (90 minutes)

1. S play round with the size of the list (e.g. the first 2500 lemmas)
2. self-reflection: how many words do they know already, and where in the frequency ranking does specifically technical vocabulary start? (<> some technical vocabulary is part of general language)

## Further details

- use [Kilgarriff’s frequency lists](https://www.kilgarriff.co.uk/bnc-readme.html) to grey out all common words in a text or video to concentrate on more advanced vocabulary

> the lists contain over 6000 words and should work quite well; use the lemma.num list because WordValue has an inbuilt lemmatiser anyway
> students can then analyse the words and find out, for instance, that there are no grammatical words left
> we need to play round with how many words to use in order to achieve a meaningful rest in this way, since e.g. equilibrium already comes around rank 4000
>> ask the students to play round with the size of the list (e.g. the first 2500 lemmas)
>> self-reflection: how many words do they know already, and where in the frequency ranking does specifically technical vocabulary start? (<> some technical vocabulary is part of general language)

- problem-based learning

![](/images/sample_text_wordvalue.png)

- in the example above, the 200 most frequent words are greened out
- one could also produce a table with the most frequent words AND the academic word list (with different codes in the second column, so that they can be distinguished by their colour)
> it is surprising to see how dense the remaining black text is

- the students may also have some ideas themselves what they could look for
> it is a qualification to be able to identify questions and come up with possible questions that can be answered by applying a specific tool
