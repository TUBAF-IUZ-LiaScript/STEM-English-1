3. What is the scope of your presentation (how much are you loading on to the audience)?
4. What was your inspiration? What were your initial ideas? Was there anything you tried but abandoned?
5. What background information, theory or technical details do your audience need to know to be able to understand your show/game?
6. Code (Product)

  - Big picture

  - Important code snippets

  - Bug examples

  - What did you already know (and from where do you know it) and what did you have to learn to complete the project?

7. Code (process)

  - How did you code? Vibe? GitHub?

8. The show/game. Demo and description
9. Conclusion
10. Reflection. What did we get from taking part in this challenge?
11. Final thought/take-home message
