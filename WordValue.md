# Ideas for problem-based English learning tasks using WordValue:

- Mark will teach two types of classes in the winter semester 2022/23:

    - Einführung in die Fachsprache (1st/2nd semester chemistry students): traditionally teaches technical terms > focus on words > do exercises 1) early on, 2) and 3), but use simple texts about science or lectures; possibly also use the chemistry transcripts  from MICASE, the Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English  (https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/c/corpus/corpus?c=micase&cc=micase&type=browse&acaddisc=200) and possibly also biology papers from MICUSP, the Michigan Corpus of Upper-Level Student Papers (https://elicorpora.info/main); aim: raise awareness what academic language is (beyond technical terms), and that it differs from the English the students have learned at school and that it is enough to look them up in a dictionary; make the students curious about and aware of the differences (in 1 and 2)

## 1

- use [Kilgarriff’s frequency lists](https://www.kilgarriff.co.uk/bnc-readme.html) to grey out all common words in a text or video to concentrate on more advanced vocabulary

> the lists contain over 6000 words and should work quite well; use the lemma.num list because WordValue has an inbuilt lemmatiser anyway
> students can then analyse the words and find out, for instance, that there are no grammatical words left
> we need to play round with how many words to use in order to achieve a meaningful rest in this way, since e.g. equilibrium already comes around rank 4000
>> ask the students to play round with the size of the list (e.g. the first 2500 lemmas)
>> self-reflection: how many words do they know already, and where in the frequency ranking does specifically technical vocabulary start? (<> some technical vocabulary is part of general language)

- problem-based learning

![](/images/sample_text_wordvalue.png)

- in the example above, the 200 most frequent words are greened out
- one could also produce a table with the most frequent words AND the academic word list (with different codes in the second column, so that they can be distinguished by their colour)
> it is surprising to see how dense the remaining black text is

- the students may also have some ideas themselves what they could look for
> it is a qualification to be able to identify questions and come up with possible questions that can be answered by applying a specific tool

## 2

Let the students mark the following in colour in their texts:

- Phrase list: https://www.lextutor.ca/freq/lists_download/phrase_list_martinez.htm
- Academic Word List : https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/lals/resources/academicwordlist/awl-headwords

> discuss what kind of vocabulary is left over and where it should be put

Let the students search for the Phrase list and the Academic Word list in a couple of academic texts; find the frequencies, put the results together (15 students with 2 texts each = 30 columns in the joint table) and discuss if the search items are frequent, if there are differences between different types of (academic) text etc.

## 3

- let the students compile their own list of technical terms and useful expressions (e.g. sequences of 3-4 words) that they find useful
- in the next step, let them check the frequency of these items in different films or texts
- check whether there is a difference in the frequency/type of hits for written texts vs. lecture transcripts (e.g. what phrases only occur in spoken/written texts; compare their results to the literature, e.g. Biber)

## 7

> How technical are technical texts?

- combine WordValue with Mark’s text grabber tool (https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nethiri/YTScriptGrabber/main/LiaScriptVersion/grabber/grabber.md#1): 

> export the text of chemistry lectures

> let the students write a list of chemistry terms

> colour-code the technical vocabulary with WordValue

> read the colour-coded text in a feedback loop to add technical vocabulary that was overlooked

> calculate the ratio of specialised to general vocabulary in a lecture

>> I don’t think that has been done before

> let the students do it and report about it first in our pedagogical article
