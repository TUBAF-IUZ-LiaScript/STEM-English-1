# WordValue as a tool for studying scientific English

This application, primarily aimed towards users from a linguistics or language teaching background, will help students of technical subjects to visualize the text from:

- scientific articles (written English) or from
- transcripts of videos (spoken English)

 and thus enable them to explore the vocabulary and structure of the texts. The digital nature of WordValue enables the easy sharing of students' findings and the integration of the application into a contemporary course setting.

## Goals of implementation

From a teaching perspective, the purpose of this session is to implement the WordValue application in university courses of English for Specific Purposes.


From a learning perspective, students use a digital application (WordValue) to aid them in exploring and exploiting online resources. The goals of the students can be divided into 4 categories (see below). In addition to the obvious aim of developing language proficiency, it is essential for university students to do this in the context of developing their digital literacy, analytical skills and competence in communicating professionally.

Language Proficiency

- To read popular scientific articles in English
- To engage in oral discussions in English

Digital Literacy

- To become a competent user of the WordValue application
- To find images appropriate for describing terminology

Analytical skills

- To extract technical vocabulary from the articles
- To associate technical terms with chosen images

Professional Communication

- To present ideas
- To work in teams

## Instructions for Students

## Open Questions:

Are there any standard pedagogical/psychological questionnaires we could use?

Are there questionnaires that would help us to link our results to the type of learner/personality type in follow-up studies?
