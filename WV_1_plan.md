# Implementation 1
_
## Background

The goal is to implement the WordValue application in university courses of English for Specific Purposes.This app, primarily aimed towards users from a linguistics or language teaching background, will help students of technical subjects to visualize the text from scientific articles (written English) or from the transcript of videos (spoken English) and thus enable them to explore the vocabulary and structure of the texts. The digital nature of WordValue enables the easy sharing of students' findings and the integration of application into a contemporary course setting.

WordValue as a tool for studying scientific English

## Open Questions:

are there any standard pedagogical/psychological questionnaires we could use?

are there questionnaires that would help us to link our results to the type of learner/personality type in follow-up studies?
