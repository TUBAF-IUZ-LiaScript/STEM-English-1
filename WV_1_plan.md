# WordValue as a tool for studying scientific English

> The goal is to implement the WordValue application in university courses of English for Specific Purposes.

This application, primarily aimed towards users from a linguistics or language teaching background, will help students of technical subjects to visualize the text from:

- scientific articles (written English) or from
- transcripts of videos (spoken English)

 and thus enable them to explore the vocabulary and structure of the texts. The digital nature of WordValue enables the easy sharing of students' findings and the integration of the application into a contemporary course setting.

## Goals of implementation

Students use WordValue to explore current popular scientific texts of 500 - 600 words. Goals for the students are:

Digital Literacy

- To become acquainted with the WordValue application
- To become a competent user of WordValue
- To find appropriate images 

Language practice

- To read popular scientific articles in English
- To speak English

Analytical skills
- To extract technical vocabulary from the articles

- To associate technical terms with chosen images

Communication skills

- To engage in oral discussions
- To work in teams

## Open Questions:

are there any standard pedagogical/psychological questionnaires we could use?

are there questionnaires that would help us to link our results to the type of learner/personality type in follow-up studies?
